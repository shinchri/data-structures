# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

Recursion is used the program similar things over and over again, and recursion is great for it.

## time complexity

Time complexity needed is `O(n)` where n is the depth of the directories/files.

## space complexity

The recurson method has 7 lines and assuming it takes `n` number of recursion needed for the task to complete. The space complexity would be `O(7n)`
