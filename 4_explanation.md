# Explanation

## Reason for choice in data structure

Similar steps need to be taken for each group. Recursion is a perfect fit for this.

## time complexity

Time complexity needed is `O(n)` where n is the number of groups.

## space complexity

The recurson method has 9 lines and assuming it takes `n` number of recursion needed for the task to complete. The space complexity would be `O(9n)` or `O(n)`
